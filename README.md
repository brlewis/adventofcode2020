# Bruce Lewis Advent of Code 2020

## 2023

I'm using this repo to help folks practice for coding interviews. You
might be one of those people, if you've already done some JavaScript
coding. If you haven't,
[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
is a good starting point.

See [src/day1/README.md](src/day1/README.md) to get started.

## 2020

This is the first year I've decided to give [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) a try. I took an extremely lazy
approach, in that most of my programming in 2020 has been on an app
set up with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If I took the time
to look into it, I'm sure I could set up `jest` with a test runner
just like the one in `create-react-app` and do away with all the
extraneous stuff in here, but I'm not taking the time to look into
it. The only extraneous thing I removed was the automated test for the
example react app, so that my own tests run faster.

Look in `src/day*` to find my code.

## Getting started

You should have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed
already. Run `nvm use`, then `npm install` to get set up. Don't worry
about vulnerability warnings when you install; these only apply for
software you're exposing to the Internet, not software used only by
you on your own computer.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\ See the
section about [running
tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.
