# Bruce Lewis Advent of Code 2020

This is the first year I've decided to give [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) a try. I took an extremely lazy approach, in that most of my programming in 2020 has been on an app set up with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If I took the time to look into it, I'm sure I could set up `jest` with a test runner just like the one in `create-react-app` and do away with all the extraneous stuff in here, but I'm not taking the time to look into it. The only extraneous thing I removed was the automated test for the example react app, so that my own tests run faster.

Look in `src/day*` to find my code.

## Getting started

You should have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed already. Run `nvm use`, then `npm install` to get set up.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
